# normalizing-flows
Implementation of normalizing flows from 1d to Nd

### Overview
This repo contains code for implementation of normalizing flows. The code and examples is largely inspired from the excellent course `Deep Unsupervised Learning` by UC Berkeley. The original code can be seen [here](https://github.com/rll/deepul/tree/master/deepul).

I found the code to be a bit messy and decided to rewrite the entire thing myself again.
